<p><b>Department Objectives</b><br/>
<br/>
The Mission of the Department of Music is to develop musicians, to support musical activities through teaching, research and performances, and to foster the appreciation of the value of music and fine arts in society.<br/>
The Department is committed to the development of musicians through options and opportunities found within the multidisciplinary context of the Faculty of Fine Arts through generalized and specialized education.<br/>
Areas of study include theory, history, instrumental and vocal studies, including ensembles and private study, composition, jazz, electroacoustics/recording, and music technology.<br/>
Academic scholarship, research, and creativity enhance faculty members’ teaching which furthers the Department’s involvement in national and international artistic and scholarly communities.<br/>
</p>

<p><b>Programs</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Students are responsible for fulfilling their particular degree requirements; hence, the following sequences must be read in conjunction with <a href="/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/sec81/81-10.html#b81.20">§81.20</a>.</i><br/>
<i>The superscript indicates credit value.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>SPECIALIZATIONS IN MUSIC</b><br/>
The Faculty of Fine Arts offers five specialization programs in Music. Students applying for entrance to the Specializations in Music Performance or Music Composition are accepted into the Major in Music. Upon completion of 30 credits, students may apply for transfer into one of those two specializations. Students applying for entrance to the Specializations in Jazz Studies, Electroacoustic Creative Practices or Electroacoustic Recording Arts may enter directly in their first year. Acceptance into a specialization is based on the student’s general academic performance in all courses, but especially in the courses relevant to their specialization.<br/>
