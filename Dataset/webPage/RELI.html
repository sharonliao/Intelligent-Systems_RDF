<p><b>Department Objectives</b><br/>
<br/>
The Department of Religions and Cultures is dedicated to the academic study of various faiths and of social and cultural phenomena affected by religions. The curriculum includes the comparative study of many religious traditions of the world. At both the undergraduate and graduate levels, students are encouraged to develop an understanding of at least two religious traditions. Whatever the student’s special focus, the informed appreciation of the beliefs and values of other cultures is considered an essential dimension of education for today’s world.</p>
