<b>Department Objectives</b><br/>
<br/>
The Department of English offers studies in literature, creative writing, and composition. Literary studies encourage appreciation and critical analysis of texts in their historical, literary, and cultural contexts. The Creative Writing program allows students to learn the craft involved in the production of original literary work. Professional Writing courses develop writing skills for use in business, technical, and other professional environments. Composition courses help to develop writing skills from basic to advanced levels.</p>

<p><b><a id="requirements" name="requirements"></a>Admission Requirements</b><br/>
<b></b><br/>
<b>TOEFL iBT REQUIREMENT</b><br/>
In order to be considered for admission to any of the programs offered by the <a href="/content/concordia/en/artsci/english">Department of English website</a>, International applicants whose first language is not English must submit a recent TOEFL iBT score of 100 or higher with a minimum of 22 on the writing section. These tests must have been written within the past 24 months.<br/>
<br/>
<b>ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR CREATIVE WRITING COURSES AND PROGRAMS</b><br/>
Creative Writing programs (Major, Minor, Honours in English and Creative Writing) are designed to develop the literary skills of students with a commitment to writing as an art form. Structured workshops guide students through the practice of their craft from introductory to advanced levels under the supervision of experienced writers. Enrolment is limited to permit constructive analysis of a student’s work.<br/>
Admission to the Creative Writing programs and courses requires approval of a creative portfolio and a letter of intent. Students wishing to enter any introductory genre course in Creative Writing (225, 226, 227) or the Creative Writing programs (Major, Minor, Honours in English and Creative Writing) must apply by submitting a letter of intent and a portfolio consisting of a maximum of 15 pages of their best writing in poetry, drama, and/or fiction (short stories or novel excerpts). For students applying to the Creative Writing programs, submission in more than one genre is required.<br/>
Portfolios and letters of intent must be submitted <b>directly</b> to the English Department office. Application deadlines for students new to Concordia or in Concordia degree programs other than the BA are November 1 (for January admission) and March 1 (for September admission). Applications in these cases will be received as early as September and January, respectively. For students currently in a BA program in another discipline, the portfolio and letter of intent must be submitted by June 1 for courses starting in September and by November 7 for courses starting in January. Since student demand regularly outpaces enrolment capacity, early application is advisable in all cases.<br/>
For further details on, and updates to, admission procedures, please consult the Department of English website.<br/>
Students are required to complete the appropriate entrance profile for entry into the program (see <a href="/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/sec31/31.html#b31.002">§31.002</a> — Programs and Admission Requirements — Profiles).<br/>

The congeries of experimental movements collectively identified as Modernism, flourishing from prior to World War I until World War II, renegotiated artistic conventions, revived neglected traditions, and turned attention to the primary materials of art (sound, colour, language). In painting emerged a tendency to abstraction, in music a tendency to atonality, and in literature to non-mimetic forms. Experiments abounded in disjunctive, elliptical, impressionistic, allusive, and mythopoeic styles. Avant-garde artists organized into numerous schools, including the Imagists, Surrealists, Dadaists, Constructivists, Futurists, and Vorticists. The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative. Much of the most important work, appropriately enough in an era of female enfranchisement, was written by women. It was also the “Jazz Age,” the nexus of which was the Harlem Renaissance.
