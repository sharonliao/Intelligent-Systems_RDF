<p><b>Department Objectives</b><br/>
<br/>
The School investigates and develops cinema as a means of artistic expression. Its programs aim to graduate filmmakers, film animators, and scholars who have a rich appreciation of the artistic and cultural potential of the medium, and also of its history and traditions. Students are exposed to the possibilities of both digital and analog technologies, and the School’s scholarly and artistic community celebrates its celluloid heritage and participates in the construction of the cinema of the future.<br/>
School programs, always evolving, embrace diversity, both in artistic formats and in the cultural values espoused through the study, creation, and dissemination of the cinema. The work of teachers, students, and artists engages with other artistic disciplines, and is grounded on academic rigour, teaching excellence, creative vision, and specific and high standards for the recruitment and admission of students, both undergraduate and graduate, who fit the School’s mission. Its mission is inseparable from its commitment to the relevance and responsibility of its activities to the community, understood as being rooted here in Montreal and Quebec, throughout Canada, and internationally.<br/>
All programs offer core courses, elective courses, lectures by visiting specialists, independent studies, and professional internships, assuring continuous contact with working professionals in the arts community. Research and creative practice by faculty are also an essential part of the School’s mission.<br/>
The BFA in Film Studies prepares graduates for professions as critics, arts administrators, educators, archivists, and curators within the regional, national, and international communities.<br/>
The BFA Film Animation and the BFA Film Production are studio programs that address practical and creative aspects of filmmaking, with the goal of providing a solid foundation for research and discovery to facilitate students’ articulation of their unique artistic personality. Film Animation programs teach the full process of frame-by-frame filmmaking, its theory, and its practice. Film Production programs instill a thorough knowledge of the mechanics involved in producing motion pictures and help students develop personal perspectives on the aesthetics of creation. Students make their own films.<br/>
