<p><b>Department Objectives</b><br/>
<br/>
The Theatre Department offers students an opportunity to explore theatre as an art form and instrument for social and personal change.<br/>
The Theatre programs provide students with a basic grounding in acting, design, production, and performance creation, and serve as preparation for advanced studies.<br/>
The Department welcomes autonomy and personal creativity in its students while encouraging initiative and collaboration. Reflecting the realities of modern theatre, it also prepares students for self-employment and entrepreneurial roles within national and international milieux.</p>
