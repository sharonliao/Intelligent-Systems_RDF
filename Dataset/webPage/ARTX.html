<p><b>Department Objectives</b><br/>
<br/>
The Department of Studio Arts offers programs that emphasize the importance of practical work with practising artists. Through a series of courses in ceramics, drawing, fibres and material practices, intermedia (video, performance and electronic arts), painting, photography, print media, and sculpture, students increase their awareness of what constitutes creativity and understanding of the aesthetic and intellectual aspects of art today.<br/>

<p><b><a id="b81.110.1" name="b81.110.1"></a>81.110.1     STUDIO ART</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Program Objective</b><br/>
<br/>
The Major in Studio Art offers students the freedom for exploration while still developing proficiency within a disciplinary core. The program encourages the cross-referencing of different creative traditions within a solid, historical, theoretical and studio foundation. Its primary objective is to give students the choice to define their own needs in tailoring an individualized program of studies within open parameters. Students are encouraged to choose among a series of studio art electives and progressively establish their concentration or concentrations through required higher-level disciplinary courses. While promoting a respect for disciplines, the program stresses diversity and versatility across studio options.<br/>
Students may select their 48 studio art credits required in any media. There is also a similar range from which students can select 12 credits in Art History. Within these specifications, students may fulfill the requirements of the Major in Studio Art either by specializing in a medium or combining studios in a number of them. However, students must complete one studio course at the 300 level (intermediate) and meet the 400 level (advanced) in the same discipline to fufill their requirements.<br/>
