<p><b>Department Objectives</b><br/>
<br/>
The Department offers programs that examine the broad vision or culture of design within contemporary society.<br/>
The Design Major is located primarily within the disciplines of image, object-making, and screen-based media in design practice with an emphasis on the study of material culture. Digital technologies are integrated into the creative process to serve as strategies and tools for enhanced communication, application, representation, and dissemination.<br/>
The Computation Arts programs are concentrated within the digital and virtual environments where computer technology is embedded in all stages of the creative process and production. The Internet as a system for communication in information and networked societies serves as the intersection that strongly links the disciplines of Design and Computation Arts. Students are encouraged to take courses across Design and Computation Arts.<br/>

<br/>
<b>Program Objective</b><br/>
<br/>
The Major in Design program explores the principal areas of visual communication and the built environment. The program encourages critical thinking and takes an interdisciplinary approach to design theory and practice. Its overarching principle is socio-cultural, environmental, and economic sustainability. Students begin their studies by developing knowledge and technical skill sets across these areas and then specialize according to their interests and abilities. The curriculum engages the student in creative work with the understanding of the impact and consequence of their designs in everyday life. In a collaborative and shared environment, students participate in diverse local outreach and community initiatives.<br/>
