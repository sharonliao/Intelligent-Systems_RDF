<p><b>Department Objectives</b><br/>
<br/>
The Department of Education offers general undergraduate programs as well as two teacher‑training programs. The general programs focus on educational issues for lifelong learning, while the teacher‑training programs are specifically for Early Childhood and Elementary Education and the Teaching of English as a Second Language. Students receive expert supervision in their field placements and are carefully guided in their methods courses.

<b>NOTE I:</b><br/>
Upon successful completion of the BEd (TESL) program and after application to the Office of the Registrar, a graduate may be recommended to the Quebec Teachers Certification Service for a “Brevet d’enseignement : autorisation personnelle permanente” (a teaching diploma). Graduates who wish to teach ESL in francophone schools, the only schools in Quebec where ESL may be taught, must satisfy the French proficiency requirements of the school board to which they apply.<br/>
There is no comparable certification process for teaching ESL at the Cegep level — Collège d’enseignement général et professionnel (junior college) or other adult level.<br/>
<br/>
<b>NOTE II:</b><br/>
To be recommended for certification, students must achieve at least a “C” grade in methodology and teaching practice courses: TESL 326<sup>6</sup>, 330<sup>3</sup>, 331<sup>3</sup>, 426<sup>6</sup>, 427<sup>3</sup>, 471<sup>3</sup>. TESL 466<sup>3</sup>, 467<sup>3</sup>, 486<sup>6</sup>, and 487<sup>6</sup> internship courses are marked on a pass/fail basis.<br/>
Students who obtain a passing grade that is below the level required for recommendation for certification are placed on conditional standing within the program and are so informed in writing by the TESL program director. Students are allowed to repeat the course(s) in question only once in order to achieve the required grade. (For the status of this grade as part of the student record, see Calendar <a href="/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/sec16/16.html#b16.2.6">§16.2.6</a>.)<br/>
Students who fail to achieve the above minimum grade in two methodology/practice teaching courses (i.e. failing to achieve a grade of “C” in the same methodology/practice teaching course twice or two different methodology/practice teaching courses) are withdrawn from the Teaching English as a Second Language Specialization program and are also so informed in writing by the TESL program director (see Calendar <a href="/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/sec16/16.html#b16.2.6">§16.2.6</a>).<br/>
Students who obtain a failing grade (F, R, or NR) in any of the courses listed above as methodology and practicum teaching are withdrawn from the program and are also informed in writing by the TESL program director.<br/>
Students must demonstrate proficiency in the language of instruction on an exam recognized by the MEES (EDUC 200 <i>English Exam for Teacher Certification</i>) prior to the start of their third internship.<br/>
<br/>
<b>NOTE III:</b><br/>
Upon admission, students may be granted exemptions from courses in TESL programs if they have completed equivalent work at the university level.<br/>
<i>Replacement for these exemptions must be made in accordance with the guidelines established by the Department of Education and approved by the University. Copies of these guidelines may be obtained in the Department of Education.<br/>
</i><br/>
<b>NOTE IV:</b><br/>
Students in the TESL Certificate must achieve at least a “C” grade in the Practicum, that is, TESL 433.
