<p><b>Department Objectives</b><br/>
<br/>
Sociology and Anthropology examine the processes of social and cultural life in diverse human societies, past and present. These core disciplines of the social sciences are closely linked to the humanities, since various aspects of culture and society concern them all.<br/>
The celebration of diversity — cultural, ethnic, and racial — among the students and faculty as well as in the subject matter, is a hallmark of the Department. It offers a full range of undergraduate programs, including joint programs in both disciplines.<br/>
