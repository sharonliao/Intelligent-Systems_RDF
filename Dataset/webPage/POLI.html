<p><b>Department Objectives</b><br/>
<br/>
The Department of Political Science offers a wide range of courses and programs to acquaint students with the living complexity of contemporary government and politics. The curriculum provides the theoretical foundations, analytical skills, and research methods for understanding the construction of government policy as well as the underlying nature and purpose of political processes and institutions. The aim is to prepare well-rounded, concerned citizens for careers in the public service and the private sector, or for graduate or law school.<br/>

The Department of Political Science offers the following programs of study: an honours, a major, and a minor.<br/>
Students seeking admission to the honours program may apply either for direct entry on the University application form or, once in the program, to the departmental honours advisor normally following the completion of 30 credits.<br/>
Students must apply to the departmental honours advisor for formal admission to either option of the honours program. Applications are due by May 15 for September admission and by November 15 for January admission. The number of places available in the Political Science Honours program is limited, and admission to the program is highly competitive. Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.5 to be eligible to apply. If admitted, they must maintain an assessment GPA of at least 3.5 to graduate with honours. In order to maintain honours status, students must obtain approval for their programs from the honours advisor each year, prior to registration.<br/>
The program of courses leading to a Minor in Political Science consists of 24 credits in the Department. The minor is designed to provide an opportunity for students to make a combination with a specialization, a major, or honours in another discipline. A student’s minor will be arranged in consultation with the Department of Political Science so that it relates to courses in the major area of study.<br/>
